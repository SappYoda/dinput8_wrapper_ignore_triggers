# dinput8_wrapper_ignore_triggers
This is a simple direct input 8 wrapper which ignores the analog triggers of controllers like the Dual Shock 4 and or Dual Sense.

This is an issue for some games like the Ys Series where analog triggers are mixed up with the analog stick.

Tested with the GOG release of Ys: The Oath in Felghana

# Install
Simply copy the dinput8.dll to the same folder where the game executable is.
